If you discover a security vulnerability in the phpkg, please report it to us as soon as possible. We take security seriously and aim to address reported issues promptly.

To report a vulnerability:

- **What to include**: Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce (if possible), and any potential impact.
- **Response time**: We will acknowledge your email within 48 hours and work with you to assess and resolve the issue.

Please refrain from disclosing the vulnerability publicly (e.g., in GitHub issues or forums) until we’ve had a chance to address it. We’ll coordinate with you on a timeline for public disclosure if necessary.

## Security Updates

Once a vulnerability is confirmed and fixed, we’ll release a patch version (e.g., 1.2.3 to 1.2.4) and update this policy with details of the fix.
