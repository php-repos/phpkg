# Contribution Guide

## Bug Reports

To encourage active collaboration, php-repos strongly encourages pull requests, not just bug reports. 
Pull requests will only be reviewed when marked as "ready for review" (not in the "draft" state) and all tests for new features are passing. 
Lingering, non-active pull requests left in the "draft" state will be closed after a few days.

However, if you file a bug report, your issue should contain a title and a clear description of the issue. 
You should also include as much relevant information as possible and a code sample that demonstrates the issue. 
The goal of a bug report is to make it easy for yourself - and others - to replicate the bug and develop a fix.

Remember, bug reports are created in the hope that others with the same problem will be able to collaborate with you on solving it. 
Do not expect that the bug report will automatically see any activity or that others will jump to fix it. 
Creating a bug report serves to help yourself and others start on the path of fixing the problem. 
If you want to chip in, you can help out by fixing [any bugs listed in our issue trackers](https://github.com/php-repos/phpkg/labels/bug). 
You must be authenticated with GitHub to view all of php-repos issues.
